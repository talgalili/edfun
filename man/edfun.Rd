\title{Creating Empirical Distribution Functions}
\usage{
edfun(x, support = range(x), dfun = NULL, qfun_method = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector of data or (in case density is not NULL) a sequance of values
for which to evaluate the density function for creating the inv-CDF.
Also, the rfun will be based on the inverse CDF on uniform distribution (inv-CDF(U[0,1]) -
which is "better" than using \link{sample}, if we have the density).}

\item{support}{a 2d numeric vector giving the boundaries of the distribution.
Default is the range of x.
This is used in qfun to decide how to work with extreme cases of q->0|1.}

\item{dfun}{a density function. If supplied, this
creates a different pfun (which now relies on \link{integrate}) and rfun (which will now rely on inv-CDF(U[0,1])).}

\item{qfun_method}{can get a quantile function to use (for example "quantile"),
with the first parameter accepts the data (x) and the second accepts probs (numeric vector of probabilities with values in [0,1]).
If it is NULL (the default) then the quantiles are estimated using \link{approxfun} from
predicting the x values from the pfun(x) values.}

\item{...}{ignored}
}
\value{
A list with 4 components: dfun, pfun, qfun and rfun.
Each one is a function to perform the usual tasks of distributions.
}
\examples{

set.seed(2016-08-18)
x <- rnorm(100)
x_funs <- edfun(x)
x_funs$qfun(0) # -2.6

# for extreme cases, we can add the support vector
x_funs <- edfun(x, support = c(-Inf, Inf))
x_funs$qfun(0) # -Inf

f <- x_funs$dfun
curve(f, -2,2)

f <- x_funs$pfun
curve(f, -2,2)

f <- x_funs$qfun
curve(f, 0,1)

f <- x_funs$rfun
hist(f(1000))
